# Prompts and Nuances Given to Copilot

1. Major UX and architecture overhaul of the weekly template system in a Gym Logbook (React + TypeScript + Supabase) app.
2. Implement a reusable library system for exercises and days.
3. Professional template builder UX, advanced exercise sorting/grouping, import day functionality.
4. Strict separation of templates/workouts/libraries, clone-not-link for all imports.
5. All new features must be modular, reusable, and follow provided UI/UX and architecture rules.
6. No cross-linking between templates/workouts/libraries.
7. All code must be TypeScript strict, no 'any', and use existing UI components.
8. SQL migration for new library tables, new types/services, UI modals, drag-and-drop, import/clone logic, confirmations, and full verification.
9. All library imports are deep clones, never references; sort/group logic is local and persisted.
10. All new features are modular and reusable.
11. Do not refactor unrelated logic. Follow existing UI styles strictly. Keep strict TypeScript. Do not use any. Reuse existing components.
12. Allow pulling existing exercises, allow pulling full existing days, fix and professionalize the exercise sorting system.
13. Improve the template-building UX to feel professional and scalable.
14. Verification checklist: modularity, strict separation, clone-not-link, strict TypeScript, UI reuse, production-ready.
15. Week generation logic: always start from Monday, generate for next week if user already trained this week, never mid-week starts.
16. Stage, commit, and push changes as requested.
17. Provide detailed commit messages and error handling.
18. Provide a text file with the full file structure and all prompts/nuances for Claude guidance.

# Additional Nuances
- Use modal-driven UX, drag-and-drop, confirmation dialogs, strict RLS in SQL, auto-focus, and validation.
- All new/modified files checked for errors, TypeScript and runtime checks passed.
- All features tested via TypeScript and runtime checks, zero errors.
- If you want to select a weekly plan, use TemplatesScreen to create or pick a template, then edit it.
- If you want to import exercises or days, use the "Library" or "Import existing day" buttons in the day card.
- Week generation logic checks last workout date and generates for next Monday if user already trained this week.
- If you haven't trained this week, it generates for the current week (always starting from Monday).
- No unrelated refactoring, strict TypeScript, no 'any', reuse of existing components, and production-ready code.
